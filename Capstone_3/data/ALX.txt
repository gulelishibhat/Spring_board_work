2/21/2021 10:27:26 PM;$ALX @drknmstr01 is the REIT guy. Let&#39;s see what he thinks of this one, trading at a cheap P/FFO. Chart not cheap yet, but soon. Basically been consolidating 15 years in an ascending T type pattern. I saw some connections between SR TLs that I wanted to draw as well. And then also just highlighted that it&#39;s had previous consolidation periods similar to (but not as long as) the one we&#39;re seeing here before strong upmoves. 7% dividend has me perfectly OK to wait, which should be more like in the mid-8/9s when I want it around 190-220.;2wired2trade
