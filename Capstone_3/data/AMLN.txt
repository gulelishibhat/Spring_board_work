And we all are invested in multiple stocks and looking for the next great ticker to add to our portfolio. \n\nPosting &quot;come to this stock, it&#39;s going to rocket&quot; without DD supporting your claim is just 4 letters to me, they mean nothing. Give people something to go off even if the DD isn&#39;t your own. \n\nI appreciate people sharing potentials with me but back it up with something other than a hope!\n\nExample:\nI believe CLIS is a great investment ATM check out this basic DD to get a good understanding of the ticker.\n\nI can now go read about the ticker, and if I like what I read I will be motivated to do my own DD. If I like the stock after that, I will invest.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/user/WiselyBroke/comments/lio84y/clickstream_clis/;The_Red_Bull_Trader
