3/18/2021 8:08:27 PM;$ANDA stock market has now tanked a couple times and we were unmoved.  After trading in the $10.10\u2019s there was a larger bid today at $10.37 that was not fulfilled. Should start seeing some movement north and hopefully less bouncing around.;Tiggers23
3/18/2021 5:31:56 PM;$BENEU so the loss on this sucks right now and I&#39;ve debated just selling and taking the loss and investing in safer commons but I know when they land a deal(and they will... Eventually) the warrants will jump up. Look at $ANDA  with a tiny 13m trust and the Warrants are at .89. BENE has over 100m in trust, the team looks good and they should be able to attract a good target from an untapped south american target... Or the US. Gotta wait it out. The whole market is down right now. Check out https://benespac.com/home/default.aspx;gimestocky

3/16/2021 5:59:39 PM;$ANDA  Get ready for the biltong!  STRYVE \n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsXK0RXlWCw;HiYldTrader
3/10/2021 12:16:22 AM;Obscure SPAC time  \n\n$ANDA - Merging with Stryve and will list as SNAX (love the ticker)\nThey make biltong which is like a healthier South African beef jerky. They have lots of industry heavy weights on the board and are expected to be profitable by the end of the year. Channing Tatum is also an investor. Very small company with massive growth potential. Warrants under a $1 are a steal. \n\n$VMAC - Merging with Anghami, it&#39;s like a Saudi Arabian/Middle Eastern Spotify. Saudi Arabia shares alot of its oil wealth with its citizens and with oil prices sky rocketing they&#39;re going to have some  large oil checks coming in which means more disposable income for it&#39;s citizens. Check out the Investor Presentation, it&#39;s an interesting play and a fun way to diversify the portfolio. Warrants at .75\n\n$SVOK - No target yet, but they&#39;re an ESG SPAC, cheapest warrants of any pre target ESG SPAC, $1 warrants\n\n$IGAC - Added more warrants, online gaming/gambling? Warrants at $1.10;Nightmare919
